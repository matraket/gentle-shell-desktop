# Platforms

> Status: draft.

**In one paragraph.** The runtime the desktop drives is cross-platform, but not evenly. pi, gentle-ai and engram document Windows, macOS and Linux. gentle-shell's README states no OS support; its support is inferred from its install provisioning (Darwin, Linux and Windows paths) and its CI on all three. On Windows, each one carries its own conditions: pi needs Bash (Git Bash by default), gentle-shell builds its private gentle-ai from source with a local Go 1.25.10+ toolchain, gentle-ai ships no Windows binaries until Authenticode signing is in place, and engram ships unsigned Windows binaries that some antivirus tools flag. The desktop itself is tested only on macOS Apple silicon, has no CI, and cannot start a chat on Windows today because of the batch-shim spawn (audit A4). Running the runtime inside WSL is documented by pi, but no pinned source recommends WSL over native Windows, and no project tests WSL in CI. This page lays out the evidence, what the desktop must solve on each platform and topology, and the risks.

## How to read this page

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **[maintainer]** | Stated in the maintainer's desktop repo (`README.md`, `electron-builder.yml`, `odd/tasks/`) or Discord messages. |
| **[gentle-shell]** | gentle-shell's own README, docs, scripts and CI at gentle-shell `main` at `ac67159` (package version 4.0.0; 19 commits after the release commit `1f35ab1`). |
| **[upstream]** | The own docs, release config and CI of pi (`pi@a13d35a`, 1.0.0), gentle-ai (`gentle-ai@ff77164`, v4.0.0) and engram (`engram@3951380`). |
| **[community]** | Framing from community members (Matrak, [issue #28, "Author's framing: review of the vision (2026-10-03)"](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell-desktop/issues/28)). |
| `Inference:` | Reasoning from cited evidence, not a stated fact. |
| `UNVERIFIED:` | Checked but not confirmed; the cell says what was checked. |

- **Citation keys.** `gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:` is the desktop repo `main`. `gentle-shell@ac67159:`, `pi@a13d35a:` (paths under `packages/coding-agent/` unless they start with `.github/`), `gentle-ai@ff77164:` and `engram@3951380:` are the pinned upstream repos. Microsoft documentation is cited by URL. Corpus pages are cited by relative path.
- **Qualified IDs.** IDs from other pages carry their page: `audit A4`, `QW-01`, `F2`, `milestone M5`, `vision Q2`. `PLAT-##` risk IDs belong to this page.
- **Open PRs.** Desktop PRs #26 and #27 are **open, not merged as of 2026-10-03**. Nothing on this page treats them as landed.
- **Platform names.** "Windows native" means Windows processes with Windows paths. "WSL" means WSL 2 with a Linux distribution; the runtime then sees a Linux system.

## Support matrix

Each piece has four rows: what its **docs** say (a support statement, or only a documented install path, labeled `Install documented:`), what its **CI** runs, which **release artifacts** exist, and **known issues**. A cell without a citation says `UNVERIFIED`.

**What the matrix says.**
- **macOS and Linux** have release artifacts or a documented install for all four upstream pieces. CI is uneven: Linux CI exists for all four; macOS CI exists for gentle-shell and gentle-ai, only as a release-time binary smoke test for pi (`pi@a13d35a:.github/workflows/build-binaries.yml:3-7`, `:139`), and not at all for engram (its workflows use only `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`). The desktop is the weak link: untested on Linux and Intel macOS.
- **Windows native** is documented by pi, gentle-ai and engram, and provisioned and tested in CI by gentle-shell (support inferred, not stated in its README), with conditions the user must meet (Bash for pi, Go for gentle-shell's gentle-ai, antivirus friction for engram).
- **WSL** is documented by pi and acknowledged by gentle-ai's `doctor` and file-mode errors. No project runs WSL in CI.
- **[community]** Matrak's note says Windows is supported "native, or via WSL — recommended" ([issue #28, "Author's framing: review of the vision (2026-10-03)"](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell-desktop/issues/28), item 5). `UNVERIFIED:` no pinned source recommends WSL over native; the closest is gentle-ai's draft PRD priority table (`gentle-ai@ff77164:PRD.md:78-79`), a planning document dated 2026-02-27, whose open question 3 asks how much to invest in native Windows (`PRD.md:1363`).

## How each piece installs and runs

| Piece | Windows native | macOS and Linux | Runtime prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pi** | Same npm command as other platforms; see the Windows page for the command environment (`pi@a13d35a:docs/quickstart.md:5`). An npm-installed `pi` lands on `PATH` as a `.cmd` shim (`gentle-shell@ac67159:docs/readme-reference.md:368`). | `curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh \| sh`, or `npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (`pi@a13d35a:docs/quickstart.md:9-19`). | Node ≥ 22.19 for npm (`docs/quickstart.md:15`); Bash on Windows (`docs/windows.md:17-23`). |
| **gentle-shell** | `npm i -g gentle-pi` (`gentle-shell@ac67159:README.md:240`). Postinstall builds the exact `v4.0.0` gentle-ai tag with a sealed Go environment (`GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, `GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org`) into a package-private directory (`docs/readme-reference.md:201`; `scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs:322-328`). | Same command. Postinstall downloads signed, SHA-256-pinned archives (`docs/readme-reference.md:201`; `scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs:112-121`). | Node ≥ 22.19 (`package.json:101-103`); Go ≥ 1.25.10 on Windows (`scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs:54`). `GENTLE_PI_SKIP_GENTLE_AI_INSTALL=1` skips the install, after which native review fails closed (`scripts/install-gentle-ai.mjs:11-12`). The private gentle-ai never uses `PATH` or a global install (`docs/readme-reference.md:201`). |
| **gentle-ai** (standalone) | `go install …@vX.Y.Z`; `gentle-ai upgrade` reruns it pinned to the release tag, and fails closed without Go (`gentle-ai@ff77164:docs/platforms.md:51-58`). | Homebrew or `install.sh` (`README.md:209-214`). | Git 2.38+, Node 18+ and npm checked on every platform (`docs/quickstart.md:36-39`). |
| **engram** | `go install …/v3/cmd/engram@latest`, or a downloaded zip added to `PATH` (`engram@3951380:docs/INSTALLATION.md:44-59`, `:99-105`). Data in `%USERPROFILE%\.engram` (`:130`). | Homebrew (stable v1.20.0 line) or release tarball (`README.md:136-142`; `docs/INSTALLATION.md:182-193`). | None at runtime; pure-Go SQLite (`docs/INSTALLATION.md:199-202`). |
| **Desktop** | Run from source; `pnpm package` builds an unsigned package for the host OS (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:README.md:7`, `:32-50`). | Same. | Node ≥ 22.19, pnpm 11, and `gentle-shell` on `PATH` or in `GENTLE_SHELL_BIN` (`README.md:11-17`; `src/main/adapters/launcherLocator.ts:19-23`). |

`Inference:` a Windows desktop user must install, before the first chat: Node, Git for Windows (for pi's Bash), Go ≥ 1.25.10 (for gentle-shell's postinstall), then `npm i -g gentle-pi`. That is four terminal-driven prerequisites for an audience the desktop targets because of terminal friction (**[community]**, [issue #28, "Author's framing: review of the vision (2026-10-03)"](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-shell-desktop/issues/28), item 2).

## What the desktop must solve

### Launcher discovery

- **Today.** `GENTLE_SHELL_BIN`, else `gentle-shell` on `PATH`; on win32 the candidates are `gentle-shell.cmd`, `gentle-shell.exe`, `gentle-shell`, in that order (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/main/adapters/launcherLocator.ts:19-23`, `:44-57`).
- **The `.mjs` path.** A `GENTLE_SHELL_BIN` ending in `.mjs` runs under the Electron binary with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` (`launcherLocator.ts:34-41`). Issue #23 verified this as a working Windows workaround.
- **Option.** `Inference:` resolving the npm shim to `<npm prefix>/node_modules/gentle-pi/bin/gentle-shell.mjs` avoids `cmd.exe` entirely. `UNVERIFIED:` the shim layout is npm's, not documented in any pinned source.

### Spawning batch shims

- **Root cause (audit A4).** The spawner calls `spawn` without `shell` (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/main/adapters/nodeProcessSpawner.ts:10`). Current Node refuses a batch file without `shell: true` (`gentle-shell@ac67159:lib/gentle-shell-launcher.ts:969-974`).
- **gentle-shell's own fix.** `planSpawn` joins `[command, ...args]` through `quoteForCmdExe` and passes `args: []` with `shell: true` (`gentle-shell@ac67159:lib/gentle-shell-launcher.ts:982-985`, `:1013-1019`). The launcher uses it for the real pi launch (`bin/gentle-shell.mjs:1393-1396`).
- **Open PR #26** (open, not merged as of 2026-10-03; head `615dd87`). It sets `windowsHide: true` always, and `shell: true` on win32 when the command (outer quotes stripped) ends in `.cmd`/`.bat`. It passes the raw command and arguments unquoted.
- **Gap.** The desktop passes paths as arguments: `--session <path>` when a session path is set, and `--home <dir>` only when `GENTLE_SHELL_HOME` is set (otherwise `--link` or `--isolated`) (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/main/domain/session/PiSession.ts:127-133`; `src/main/domain/home/home.ts:33-36`). The command itself is a raw path: the locator returns `path.join(dir, name)` unquoted (`src/main/adapters/launcherLocator.ts:53-54`), and PR #26 passes it to `spawn` as is. PR #26's quoted-path test feeds an already quoted string (`'"C:\\Program Files\\gentle-shell.cmd"'`) and asserts only `shell: true`. `Inference:` (not run) with `shell: true` and unquoted tokens, an npm prefix or argument path with spaces or `&|<>^%()` is split or reinterpreted by `cmd.exe`. QW-01's RED test asks for "quoted tokens" ([QW-01](09-roadmap.md#qw-01-windows-cmd-spawn-audit-a4)); PR #26 does not meet it.

### Console windows

- **Issue #24.** One visible console per open chat; closing it kills that chat's backend. The reporter notes the window "may belong to the grandchild `pi` process".
- **Evidence for both layers.** PR #26 hides only the direct child. gentle-shell hides its internal Git and system probes (`windowsHide: true`, e.g. `gentle-shell@ac67159:lib/session-worktree-registry.ts:34`), but its pi launch passes no `windowsHide` (`bin/gentle-shell.mjs:1396`).
- `UNVERIFIED:` which process owns the window. gentle-shell's own capture protocol shows how to prove it (`gentle-shell@ac67159:docs/windows-startup-console-visibility.md:7-14`). The fix may need gentle-shell, not only the desktop.

### PATH and environment from a GUI launch

- **macOS.** Apps opened from Finder lack the shell `PATH`, so `gentle-shell` and `node` are not found (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:README.md:52-58`; audit A18).
- **Windows.** gentle-ai already works around processes with a stale `PATH` on Windows ("Fresh install detection falls back to known Engram/GGA install locations", `gentle-ai@ff77164:docs/platforms.md:65`), and warns when `go install` writes outside the resolved `PATH` (`docs/platforms.md:55`). `UNVERIFIED:` whether a desktop started from the Start menu sees a `PATH` changed by a recent `npm i -g`.
- **Linux.** `UNVERIFIED:` the environment of an `AppImage` started from a desktop launcher was not checked.

### Home directories

- **Desktop homes.** Isolated home is `<homedir>/.gentle-shell/agent`; linked is `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` or `<homedir>/.pi/agent` (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/main/domain/home/home.ts:45-47`, `:56-67`). On native Windows `homedir` is the Windows profile; gentle-ai lists Pi's Windows config at `%USERPROFILE%\.pi\` (`gentle-ai@ff77164:docs/platforms.md:85`).
- **In-process session list.** The desktop reads sessions in-process from that directory (audit A1). `Inference:` when the runtime lives in WSL (topology B), its homes are under the Linux `/home`, so the Windows-side list would read the wrong directory unless it reads them through `\\wsl$` (Microsoft: Linux files appear under `\\wsl$`, [filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)). `UNVERIFIED:` pi's session store over a `\\wsl$` UNC path.
- **gentle-ai.** In v4.0.0, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` absolute or relative forms are honored only when the home is the real user home (`gentle-ai@ff77164:internal/agents/pi/adapter.go:384-393`). `UNVERIFIED:` the effect on desktop-managed homes.

### File modes (POSIX metadata)

- **The limitation.** gentle-ai reports that the clone-local review-mode path "cannot be made private" when "the filesystem hosting it does not persist POSIX permission modes (WSL DrvFS without the metadata option, exFAT, and SMB without POSIX extensions…)" (`gentle-ai@ff77164:internal/cli/review_mode.go:290-297`; repair text at `internal/reviewtransaction/rar_path_safety.go:70`). gentle-shell surfaces it as `candidate-owner-parent-chmod-ineffective` (`gentle-shell@ac67159:docs/readme-reference.md:528`).
- **Default.** Microsoft documents DrvFS `metadata` as `disabled` by default ([wsl-config, automount options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config)).
- **Desktop impact.** `Inference:` a WSL user whose repository sits under `/mnt/c` cannot start an RDD review until they remount with `metadata` or move the repo. The mockup's status bar shows `ODD · RDD on` (`gs-mockup.html:822`), so the desktop should show this error plainly, not as a generic failure. Microsoft also recommends keeping project files in the Linux file system when working from a Linux command line ([filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)).

### Packaging and signing

- **Today.** Unsigned on every platform: mac `identity: null`; no signing settings for `win` or `linux` (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:electron-builder.yml:25-38`). No auto-update (`README.md:64`).
- **Upstream precedent.** gentle-ai holds all Windows binaries until Authenticode signing exists (`gentle-ai@ff77164:docs/platforms.md:21`, `:59`). engram ships unsigned Windows binaries and documents antivirus false positives (`engram@3951380:docs/INSTALLATION.md:109-127`).
- **Roadmap.** Signing belongs to [milestone M5](09-roadmap.md#m5-signing-and-auto-update); which platforms M5 covers is `UNVERIFIED` there. The signing part of audit A18 is listed under M5.

### WSL topologies

| | A. Desktop and runtime native on Windows | B. Desktop native, runtime inside WSL | C. Desktop and runtime inside WSL (WSLg) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What runs where** | Electron `.exe`; `gentle-shell.cmd`, `pi.cmd`, private `gentle-ai.exe`, `engram.exe` on Windows. | Electron `.exe` on Windows; `gentle-shell`, pi, gentle-ai, engram in a WSL distribution. | Linux `AppImage`, displayed through WSLg; the whole runtime in the distribution. |
| **Spawn** | `cmd.exe` with quoted tokens, as `planSpawn` (audit A4). | `wsl.exe` with the Linux command; "the commands passed into `wsl.exe` are forwarded to the WSL process without modification", and a distribution is chosen with `wsl --distribution <name>` ([filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems); [basic commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands)). | Same as Linux. |
| **Paths** | Windows paths. | "File paths must be specified in the WSL format" ([filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)), so `--session` and `--home` need translation. For environment variables, the `WSLENV` flag `/p` "translates the path between WSL/Linux style paths and Win32 paths" (same page). `Inference:` that covers paths carried in environment variables, not command-line arguments, so the desktop must translate argument paths itself or pass them through translated variables. `UNVERIFIED:` `wslpath` and `--cd`/`--exec` flags are not documented on the pages read. | Linux paths. |
| **Environment** | Inherited. | `Inference:` the desktop's `GENTLE_SHELL_INTERACTIVE_HOST` (`PiSession.ts:134`) crosses only if listed in `WSLENV`, "a list of environment variables to share between Windows and WSL" ([filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)). | Inherited. |
| **stdio** | Pipes. | Microsoft documents piping and redirection through `wsl` ([filesystems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems)). `UNVERIFIED:` long-lived JSONL over that pipe, and whether killing `wsl.exe` stops the Linux process tree. | Pipes. |
| **Homes and sessions** | Windows profile. | Linux homes; the in-process session list needs `\\wsl$` access (see [Home directories](#home-directories)). | Linux homes. |
| **Requirements** | Node, Git for Windows, Go ≥ 1.25.10 (see [How each piece installs](#how-each-piece-installs-and-runs)). | WSL 2. `Inference:` a distribution with Node ≥ 22.19 and the runtime installed (the Linux install path applies), and the desktop must know which distribution to target, since `wsl.exe` selects one with `--distribution <name>` ([basic commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/basic-commands)). | Windows 10 build 19044+ or Windows 11, WSL 2, a vGPU driver ([GUI apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)). |
| **Known blockers** | audit A4, issue #24, unsigned `.exe`. | DrvFS file modes for repos under `/mnt/c`; launcher discovery inside the distribution; no tested precedent in any pinned repo. | Desktop Linux build untested (`README.md:7`). Microsoft: WSLg "does not provide a full desktop experience" ([GUI apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)). `UNVERIFIED:` notifications, tray and file dialogs under WSLg. |
| **Assessment** | `Inference:` the shortest path: every upstream piece supports it and gentle-shell already solved the spawn. | `Inference:` the most work: a new spawner and path, env and home bridging. Fits users whose code lives in WSL (pi's own guidance, `pi@a13d35a:docs/windows.md:13`). | `Inference:` needs no new code, but the experience is a Linux app on Windows. |

## Risks

| ID | Risk | Platform | Evidence | Impact | Mitigation | Related |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLAT-01 | No chat starts on Windows. | Windows native | `nodeProcessSpawner.ts:10`; issue #23 (reproduced by a tester) | High: core flow blocked. | Route batch shims as `planSpawn` does, with quoted tokens; or resolve the `.mjs` entry. Reproduce before and after. | audit A4, QW-01, F2 |
| PLAT-02 | A partial fix splits paths with spaces or `cmd.exe` metacharacters. | Windows native | PR #26 passes the unquoted command path and args with `shell: true`; `launcherLocator.ts:53-54`; `PiSession.ts:127-133` | Medium: chats fail only for some users (`Inference:`, not run). | Require the quoted-token test from QW-01. | audit A4, QW-01 |
| PLAT-03 | One visible console per chat; closing it kills the chat. | Windows native | Issue #24; `bin/gentle-shell.mjs:1396` has no `windowsHide` | Medium: confusing UX, data-loss risk on close. | Prove the owner with gentle-shell's capture protocol; fix in the desktop, gentle-shell, or both. | audit A4 |
| PLAT-04 | gentle-shell install fails on Windows without Go ≥ 1.25.10. | Windows native | `scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs:54`, `:343-346`; `scripts/install-gentle-ai.mjs:14-20` | High for the target audience: first run blocked before the app can help. | Detect and explain in first run; ask whether skipping gentle-ai or a bundled runtime is acceptable. | vision Q2, F2 |
| PLAT-05 | pi cannot find Bash. | Windows native | `pi@a13d35a:docs/windows.md:19-23`, `:31` | Medium: tool calls fail. | Check in first run; link to Git for Windows or `shellPath`. | F2 |
| PLAT-06 | RDD review cannot start for repos on DrvFS without `metadata`. | WSL (B, C) | `gentle-ai@ff77164:internal/cli/review_mode.go:290-297`; Microsoft default `metadata` disabled | Medium: native review cannot start for those repos. Whether users meet it depends on the RDD default, which the corpus records as contradictory: gentle-shell calls RDD opt-in (`gentle-shell@ac67159:README.md:291`), while gentle-ai v4.0.0 resolves an unset mode to on (inventory R1, [05-capability-inventory.md](05-capability-inventory.md)). | Show the upstream error and its two continuations; recommend Linux file system projects. | — |
| PLAT-07 | The session list reads the wrong home when the runtime is in WSL. | WSL (B) | `home.ts:56-67`; audit A1 | High for topology B: the sidebar shows no chats (`Inference:`). | Move session listing to RPC, or read through `\\wsl$`; decide topology first. | audit A1, A2 |
| PLAT-08 | Unsigned builds blocked or flagged. | All | `electron-builder.yml:25-38`; `README.md:58`; engram AV note | Medium: users cannot open the app, or distrust it. | M5 signing per platform; document the first-open workaround meanwhile. | audit A18, milestone M5 |
| PLAT-09 | Packaged app cannot find the launcher from a GUI launch. | macOS (documented); Windows, Linux (`UNVERIFIED`) | `README.md:52-58`; `gentle-ai@ff77164:docs/platforms.md:65` | Medium: app fails on a normal launch. | Resolve the login-shell `PATH` or save a chosen launcher path. | audit A18, F2 |
| PLAT-10 | Regressions on untested platforms. | Windows, Linux, macOS Intel | No desktop CI; only Apple silicon tested (`README.md:7`) | Medium: breakage found by users. | CI on Linux (xvfb) and Windows once audit A4 lands. | audit A16, QW-04, F2 |
| PLAT-11 | Upstream Windows docs disagree with v4.0.0. | Windows native | `gentle-ai@ff77164:README.md:216-217` still `@v3.7.0`; `docs/platforms.md:4` says install commands "track the latest release" | Low: users install a stale gentle-ai standalone. `Inference:` gentle-shell's private gentle-ai is unaffected (`scripts/gentle-ai-installer.mjs:39`, `:47`). | Report upstream; desktop docs point to gentle-shell, not standalone gentle-ai. | — |

## Open questions for the maintainer

1. Which Windows topology is the target: A (native), B (desktop native, runtime in WSL) or C (everything in WSL)? No pinned source recommends WSL over native (see the matrix note).
2. Is it acceptable that Windows users need Go ≥ 1.25.10 to install gentle-shell, or should the desktop's first run handle it (and does that change vision Q2, bundled vs external runtime)?
3. Should the desktop spawn the npm `.cmd` shim through `cmd.exe` (as `planSpawn`), or resolve and run the `.mjs` entry directly?
4. Which platforms and signing schemes does milestone M5 cover: Apple notarization only, or also Authenticode and Linux?
5. Should the Windows console fix live in gentle-shell (its pi launch) as well as in the desktop?
6. Is macOS Intel a target for desktop builds?

## Host service (proposal 0004)

> **[community] proposal, not current state.** [Proposal 0004](07-proposals/0004-host-service.md) proposes one local host service between every client and `gentle-shell --mode rpc`; its architecture is in [11-host-service.md](11-host-service.md) and its topologies in [13-clients-and-topologies.md](13-clients-and-topologies.md). Nothing in this section exists today. Paths with a `paseo@485221b:` or `t3code@eac52f0:` prefix are in those pinned repositories (see [13, Sources](13-clients-and-topologies.md#sources)).

### Service lifecycle per OS

Who starts and stops the service depends on [process placement](11-host-service.md#process-placement-open), which is open.

| Placement | Who starts it | Who stops it | Per-OS notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(b) Embedded in Electron main** | The app. | The app. | `Inference:` as today: closing the last window quits the app on every platform except macOS (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/main/index.ts:124-126`), and every chat stops with it. |
| **(a) Started by the app** | The app, or it connects to a service already running. | The app on quit, or nobody if the service is kept running for other clients. | `Inference:` the same on every OS; Paseo stops a daemon it started unless `keepRunningAfterQuit` is set ([11, Process placement](11-host-service.md#process-placement-open)). |
| **(a) Standalone, for browser or phone clients** | A per-user service of the OS, or the user from a terminal. | The OS at logout or shutdown, or the user. | T3 Code's precedent: on Linux it "needs systemd user services" and enables lingering so it "starts at boot and keeps running after logout"; on macOS it starts "when you log in" and stops "when you log out", through a LaunchAgent; "Windows background services are not supported." (`t3code@eac52f0:docs/user/background-service.md:45-54`, `:94`). |

Whether a standalone service starts at login is open: [CT-03](13-clients-and-topologies.md#open-questions). `Inference:` on Windows no pinned precedent provides a background service, so a Windows user of a browser or phone client would depend on the desktop app, or on a service inside WSL (below).

### Port and loopback binding

- **Today.** There is no port: the renderer reaches main through 8 request and 2 push IPC channels (`gentle-shell-desktop@5ab4a00:src/shared/ipc-channels.ts:8-23`).
- **Proposed.** **[community]** The service binds to loopback by default ([proposal 0004](07-proposals/0004-host-service.md#proposal)); whether loopback clients still need a credential is [HP-07](12-host-protocol.md#open-questions).
- **Precedents.** Paseo listens on `127.0.0.1:6767` by default (`paseo@485221b:packages/server/src/server/config.ts:38`, `:470`) and can listen on a Unix socket instead (`:466-469`), of which Paseo says: "The CLI supports this mode, but the mobile app and web interface require a network connection." (`paseo@485221b:public-docs/security.md:63`). T3 Code binds to `127.0.0.1` (`t3code@eac52f0:apps/server/src/server.ts:249`) with default port `3773` (`t3code@eac52f0:apps/server/src/config.ts:23`). Paseo publishes the bound endpoint in a `paseo.pid` record that its CLI trusts (`paseo@485221b:docs/architecture.md:471`, `:475`).
- `Inference:` a fixed port can collide with another program, or with an older service still running (version skew, B3); a published endpoint record lets clients find a service on any port. Which to use is undecided.

### Service on Windows or inside WSL

| | Service on Windows | Service inside WSL |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Native (topology A above) or inside WSL through `wsl.exe` (topology B above). | Inside the same distribution, spawned as on Linux. |
| **Bridging** | Topology B's path, `WSLENV` and `\\wsl$` bridging stays ([WSL topologies](#wsl-topologies)). | `Inference:` none between service and runtime; only the client socket crosses, through WSL localhost forwarding or the distribution's IP address. `UNVERIFIED:` the reliability of localhost forwarding: T3 Code binds `0.0.0.0` inside WSL because "wslhost forwarding is unreliable on some Windows hosts", and advertises the distribution's IP (`t3code@eac52f0:apps/desktop/src/backend/DesktopBackendConfiguration.ts:616-627`). |
| **Session list** | PLAT-07 applies under topology B. | `Inference:` the listing runs in the distribution and reads the Linux homes. |
| **Detail** | [WSL topologies](#wsl-topologies) | [13, T3 Service inside WSL](13-clients-and-topologies.md#t3-service-inside-wsl) |

Which one is the Windows target is open: [CT-04](13-clients-and-topologies.md#open-questions), alongside question 1 above.

### Host service packaging and signing

- **Embedded or started by the app.** `Inference:` shipped inside the app, the service can run under the app's own Electron binary in Node mode, so it adds no second binary to sign ([11, Process placement](11-host-service.md#process-placement-open)); it inherits this page's [Packaging and signing](#packaging-and-signing) state (unsigned today) and [milestone M5](09-roadmap.md#m5-signing-and-auto-update).
- **Standalone.** A second distributable to package, sign and update, such as Paseo's `paseo` CLI or T3 Code's `t3` ([11, Process placement](11-host-service.md#process-placement-open)). `Inference:` M5's open platform scope (question 4 above) then covers two artifacts.
- **Inside WSL.** A Linux build of the service installed in the distribution. T3 Code "installs its own server runtime there automatically" (`t3code@eac52f0:docs/user/install.md:76-77`).

### Host service risks

These continue the [Risks](#risks) table.

| ID | Risk | Platform | Evidence | Impact | Mitigation | Related |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PLAT-12 | A service inside WSL is shut down with an idle distribution. | WSL | `.wslconfig` `[general]` `instanceIdleTimeout`, default `15000` ms, and `[wsl2]` `vmIdleTimeout`, default `60000` ms, "The number of milliseconds that a VM is idle, before it is shut down" (Windows 11 only) ([wsl-config](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config), fetched 2026-10-05); `UNVERIFIED:` whether a running service counts as activity | Medium: clients lose the service (`Inference:`). | Test it; set the timeout or keep the distribution running. | CT-04 |
| PLAT-13 | A loopback service inside WSL is reachable from every Windows process. | WSL | `localhostForwarding` defaults to `true` ([wsl-config](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config)); Windows apps reach Linux servers on `localhost` ([networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking), fetched 2026-10-05). T3 Code goes further: it binds `0.0.0.0` inside WSL, exposing its server on the WSL virtual network (`t3code@eac52f0:apps/desktop/src/backend/DesktopBackendConfiguration.ts:616-627`) | Medium: "local" spans two systems (`Inference:`). | A loopback credential. | HP-07 |
| PLAT-14 | No pinned precedent runs a background service on Windows. | Windows native | "Windows background services are not supported." (`t3code@eac52f0:docs/user/background-service.md:54`) | Low until browser or phone clients exist (`Inference:`). | Keep the service tied to the app on Windows, or run it inside WSL. | CT-03 |
