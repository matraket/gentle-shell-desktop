# Gentle Desktop documentation corpus

Shared ground for everyone working on Gentle Desktop: what we are building, why, how it works today, what gentle-shell already does that the desktop must expose, and how the community organizes around it. The roadmap is one document among these, derived from the others.

## How to read it

1. Start with the [vision](00-vision.md) and the [glossary](01-glossary.md).
2. Understand the pieces in the [ecosystem](02-ecosystem.md).
3. Go deep on [architecture](03-architecture/), the [RPC contract](04-rpc-contract.md) and the [capability inventory](05-capability-inventory.md).
4. Then [UX](06-ux/), [proposals](07-proposals/), [team](08-team.md) and the [roadmap](09-roadmap.md).
5. For Windows, macOS, Linux and WSL support, read [platforms](10-platforms.md) after the audit and the roadmap.
6. For the proposed shared host service (browser and mobile clients), read [proposal 0004](07-proposals/0004-host-service.md), then its [architecture](11-host-service.md), [protocol](12-host-protocol.md) and [clients and topologies](13-clients-and-topologies.md).

**IDs across documents.** IDs collide between pages (inventory A1–A12 and U1–U8, audit A1–A21, UX U1–U12). Inside its home page an ID is written bare; anywhere else it carries a qualifier: `inventory A5` ([capability inventory](05-capability-inventory.md)), `audit A5` ([audit](03-architecture/audit.md)), `UX U3` ([UX principles](06-ux/principles.md)), `design D3` ([design system](06-ux/design-system.md)), `gap G1` ([RPC contract](04-rpc-contract.md#gaps-the-desktop-needs)), `vision P2` and `vision Q1` ([vision](00-vision.md)), `ADR 0007` ([ADRs](03-architecture/adr/)), `SCR-03` ([screens](06-ux/screens.md)), `governance D7` ([team](08-team.md)), `QW-01` ([roadmap](09-roadmap.md)), `PLAT-01` ([platforms](10-platforms.md)), `HP-01` ([host protocol](12-host-protocol.md#open-questions)), `CT-01` ([clients and topologies](13-clients-and-topologies.md#open-questions)), `topology T1` to `topology T5` ([clients and topologies](13-clients-and-topologies.md#topologies); never a bare `T1` outside that page, because `inventory T1` exists) and `M2 scope D2` (the maintainer's `odd/tasks/desktop-m2-helpers.md`). Watch the pairs that share a letter: `inventory Q6` (a desktop search) vs `vision Q1`, and `milestone M3` (a desktop milestone) vs `inventory M3`. A qualifier covers the IDs listed after it (`audit A3, A11`). A page may declare a bare form in its own legend, as the roadmap does for milestones M1–M6.

## How to propose changes

Open a pull request against the document. Maintainer vision lives in `00-vision.md`; new ideas from the community go to `07-proposals/` until the maintainer accepts them.
